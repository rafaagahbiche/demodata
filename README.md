In this project I wanted to use ASP .NET MVC 5 and custom jQuery plugin.
I used three controllers in one page (multiple partial views) and using partial loading avoiding reloading the page everytime we update the data. 
In terms of architecture/design strategy, I used Dependency injection via Ninject library, the repository pattern and Unit of Work pattern
